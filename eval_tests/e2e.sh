#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Automated end-to-end suite for webserv (drives the whole server over real
# HTTP). Serves as the regression gate: re-run it on every change to confirm
# nothing that already worked has broken.
#
# Non-interactive: starts the server with config/example.conf, fires requests,
# asserts on the actual responses, and exits 0 only if every check passes (so it
# works as a pre-commit / CI gate). Complements the interactive run_tests.sh.
#
# Each case maps to a feature we care about not regressing: standard HTTP,
# uploads, redirects, CGI (GET/POST/env/failure/timeout), alias-style path
# resolution (prefix stripped then joined onto root, for both static files and
# CGI scripts), and the crash/hang/leak fixes (location-less server, non-CGI
# file in a CGI dir, client drops, zombie reaping, overall liveness).
#
# Usage: tests/e2e.sh        # builds if needed, runs everything
#   Header changes: run `make re` first (the Makefile has no header deps).
